These are some songs I made as part of a class I took in college. Consequently, they are quite goofy, so I hope you get some form of enjoyment from listening. The track displaying "song-3" when the mouse hovers over the image is a cover. Look up "Coffee and Cigarettes" by the Rock City Angels if you want hear the original. 

P.S.: that handsome guy in the middle is my cat, Tomothy.
